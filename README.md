# <title> Inherent Customer Value  

  Entrepreneurs normally want to find the customers who value their prod- ucts the most. Economists represent overall customer value in a concept called “willingness to pay.” Customers with the highest willingness to pay assign the highest value to these products relative to others. But what drives this value?
As an example, ask yourself what you are willing to pay for a cool, refresh- ing can of soda. Often, this price depends on context—is it hot or cold outside?— and on other available options—are juice or iced tea also offered? Depending on the circumstances, your possible alternative prices might range from nothing (you don’t like soda) to very high prices like $8 (you are in a hotel at 3 a.m. after a long flight and could use a caffeine hit to get those PowerPoint slides finished!). Economists say your willingness to pay for a soda will be the price that just leaves you indifferent between having a soda or not.  
  For a venture, therefore, customers’ willingness to pay represents potential: it is the maximum amount of value that can be generated by supplying custom- ers with the product. Of course, willingness to pay depends not only on the prod- uct delivered, but also on the customer being targeted (see **Mini Case: What’s the Value of a Miracle?**). In practice, customers rarely must pay a price equal to their willingness to pay due to the natural dispersion of customer preferences and constraints. For example, companies like Uber and Lyft know that even if you are hesitant to take a rideshare to the party at current surge prices, chances are there are many others who are not hesitant and will pay the price without blinking. Moreover, the price ultimately charged also reflects several market factors, including the degree of competition and the number of substitutes. Your indifference to pay for a rideshare at that point may also reflect the ease of public transportation in your neighborhood, or even your interest in going to the party at all.  
  While the willingness to pay defines the potential value for a given customer, it is also important to consider the costs of delivering that value. For instance, most travelers would be willing to pay more to fly in a private jet rather than a commercial airline. However, that does not mean using private jets creates the most value for most people. While a private jet has higher inherent value to a customer, the costs of supplying it are also higher. For most individuals, even if they paid their willingness-to-pay price for a private jet, it would not cover the costs of supplying the trip. Put another way, there is no price a private jet ser- vice could charge to viably serve these customers; it wouldn’t take many trips for the service to be bankrupt. As a result, most travelers, despite preferring travel on a private jet, remain commercial airline customers.

## <title> **SIGNIFICANCE OF THE S-CURVE PATTERN**  
Why does the S-curve pattern happen?

1. *Market adoption simply cannot be faster than the speed that related knowledge diffuses through the population of potential customers.*  

  The reason for this pattern is akin to how a viral disease might spread through a population: it infects a few people, who then infect a few more people, repeating the process until it reaches an inflection point when it moves throughout most of the population. Close contact hastens this spread, allowing the virus to disperse through the majority of a given community well before it reaches the majority in the broader
community. In this sense, the knowledge about Internet retail first spread through the software and start-up community, then more broadly to big box retailers and their adjacent competitors, and then finally into small businesses.
  
But for market adoption, knowledge diffusion is only the first step.  

2. *Critically, customers must change their behavior as they come to under- stand a new product and its usefulness.* This process takes time and often plays out more slowly than anticipated by entrepreneurs. But it is a pattern that is pervasive across a range of products and sectors (see **Deep Dive S Curve across Innovative Products** on p. 000).

  
  To be clear, compared with Griliches’s era, there is some evidence that diffusion has become somewhat quicker over time. Urban density has increased, placing more early adopters in close contact with potential follow-on cus- tomers and expanding opportunities for exchange of personal recommenda- tions as well as direct observations of new products in use (e.g., “Siri, when’s the next bus?”). Technologies relating to the Internet have also eased the acquisition of new information. Whether consumers use Wikipedia for background knowledge, Yelp for service reviews, or Instagram for viral sto- ries, the Internet provides them with faster access to a broader array of information than ever before. Further spurred by higher levels of education, these increases in urban density and Internet access have also reduced the barriers to behavioral change by facilitating deeper understanding of the uses for new products (e.g., YouTube product unboxings, reviews, and instruc- tional videos).
